## Summary

This is the front-end development for "Employee-service" (found in repository) springboot project. I have created front end using Angular JS which in turn connects to the REST API.
The tutorial.html page displays the front-end application and each update,delete,add,employee-info html pages are saved in the respective folders.
The main purpouse of this project is to demonstrate a full-stack application, where the Angular JS effectively communicates with the backend REST API and displays fetched information from MySQL database in the UI.
